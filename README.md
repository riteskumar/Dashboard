# Dashboard
The project is a responsive and fully deployed data dashboard that visualizes information using various types of charts, including line graphs, bar graphs, and pie charts. The dashboard is designed to provide users with a clear and interactive interface to analyse data trends.
### Data Visualization:
The dashboard includes multiple types of charts (line graphs, bar charts, pie charts) to display data in a visually appealing and informative way.
### Responsiveness: 
Built with responsiveness in mind, the dashboard adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes, ensuring a user-friendly experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
### Interactive Charts:
The charts are interactive, allowing users to hover over data points for more detailed information, filter data, or adjust the view dynamically.
